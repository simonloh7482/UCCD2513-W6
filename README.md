UCCD2513 T14 Week 6 Activity

1. Write a program to segment the boat and the people on it from the background. Follow the instruction below:
    - Use 'boat.jpg' as input.
    - Apply Otsu thresholding.
    - Draw bounding box to identify the region where the boat and people are located.

2. Write a program to visualize the effect of size of structuring element on the morphological transformation (e.g. erosion, dilation, opening, and closing).
    - Load the 'leaf.jfif' and perform thresholding to segment the leaf from the background.
    - Create a GUI containing trackbar to control the size of structuring element and display the resulting image on a window alongside the trackbar.

3. Apply the steps shown in exercise 4 to segment the porcelain from these images: "porcelain1.jfif" - "porcelain5.jfif".
